## Game Logic 🧠

- **Game Sequence (`gameseq`)**: Random color sequence generated by the system.
- **User Sequence (`userseq`)**: Colors clicked by the user.
- **Leveling Up**: Each correct sequence completion moves the player to the next level with an extra color added.
- **Button Flash**: Selected button flashes white to indicate sequence steps and user clicks.
- **Game Over**: On a wrong input, background flashes red and score is shown.
